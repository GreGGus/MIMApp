## Project Structure

The project structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. This structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [awesome writeup](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) by [Justin Greenberg](https://github.com/justingreenberg).

## Building for Production

## Deployment

Out of the box, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `./dist` folder generated by `yarn build`. This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure, since that demands a more opinionated structure that makes it difficult to extend the starter kit. The simplest deployment strategy is a [static deployment](#static-deployments).

### Static Deployments

Serve the application with a web server such as nginx by pointing it at your `./dist` folder. Make sure to direct incoming route requests to the root `./dist/index.html` file so that the client application will be loaded; react-router will take care of the rest. If you are unsure of how to do this, you might find [this documentation](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#configuring-your-server) helpful. The Express server that comes with the starter kit is able to be extended to serve as an API and more, but is not required for a static deployment.
